# Smart House

This project is designed as a small budget type of smart home systems. This project consists of transferring the values read from sensors to the device with android operating system with the help of bluetooht after placing various sensors at home. You can also manage this system from the android device or make various adjustments. The system includes a garage parking system with distance sensor, alarm system with motion sensor, natural gas alarm system with MQ-4 sensor, remote controllable light system and DHT11 temperature and humidity measurement system. When a situation occurs while the alarm systems are activated, a warning is given by buzzer both from the android device and from the system itself.

## Getting Started

Download a copy of the project files to your local machine to run the project. Obtain the necessary environments and electronic materials. Install the necessary circuit with the materials you have acquired. Install the software on any android device. Communicate with the circuit through the software and start using it.

### Prerequisites

- Sensors and materials required for the circuit
- A device with Android software system
- Android Studio
- Arduino IDE

To run the project, first get any version of the IDE software suitable for your system from [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and install it on your local machine. Then open the files for android that you downloaded to your local machine in this environment. After making the necessary adjustments, get the apk extension of the application. Upload this file to a device with android software.

Get the necessary materials for Arduino and create the circuit. Arduino, obtain any version of the IDE software for your system from [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) and install it on your local machine. Install the Arduino software to the processor with the Arduino IDE by making the Arduino-pc connection. Establish a bluetooth connection between the circuit that is running and the application. Remember to test the system before using it. Make sure the links are well done.
